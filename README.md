# Web-Network-Security-VAPT-Audit
To identify, analyze, and report potential security vulnerabilities in a web application and  its associated network infrastructure using industry-standard VAPT methodologies. The  project aims to simulate real-world attack vectors to improve system security posture. 

# Tools & Environment:
- Kali Linux / Parrot OS (penetration testing environment)
- Nmap (network scanning & enumeration)
- Burp Suite (web application vulnerability scanning)
- OWASP ZAP (open-source web security scanner)
- Nikto (web server scanning)
- Metasploit Framework (exploit execution)
- Wireshark (network packet analysis)
- Browser Developer Tools / Postman (API testing)

# Key Work Done: 
- Performed network reconnaissance and scanning using Nmap 
- Identified open ports, services, and misconfigurations 
- Conducted web application scanning using OWASP ZAP & Burp Suite 
- Detected vulnerabilities like:
  - SQL Injection 
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) 
  - Broken Authentication & Session Management
- Simulated exploitation scenarios with Metasploit (ethically and in controlled 
environment) 
- Reviewed HTTP headers and HTTPS implementation for SSL/TLS issues 
- Documented all findings with CVSS scores and recommended mitigations

# Outcome: 
Produced a comprehensive VAPT audit report highlighting security loopholes in the web 
and network layers. Offering actionable insights and remediation strategies to harden 
the application and infrastructure against common threats. Strengthened understanding 
of ethical hacking and defensive security practices.
