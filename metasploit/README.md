# metasploit(msfconsole)
Metasploit Framework is a powerful, extensible, open-source penetration testing platform used by security professionals to develop and execute exploit code against target systems, automate vulnerability verification, and perform post-exploitation tasks. Originally created as an exploit development platform, Metasploit has evolved into a full-featured toolkit that speeds up the penetration testing workflow by providing a standardized way to combine exploits, payloads, auxiliary modules and post-exploitation tools.
